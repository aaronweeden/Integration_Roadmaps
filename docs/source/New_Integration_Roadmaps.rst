Make a New ACCESS Integration Roadmap
#####################################

If you want to integrate a cyberinfrastructure resource into the ACCESS ecosystem
and no existing integration roadmap seems appropriate for your resources, you may
want to propose a new ACCESS integration roadmap. This page explains the benefits
of an integration roadmap and how to create a new one.

**What does it mean to integrate a cyberinfrastructure resource with ACCESS?** For
most resources, integration with ACCESS means participating in one or more of
ACCESS's coordination services. These coordination services (listed below) make the
ACCESS ecosystem---including the individual resources within it---easier for researchers
to understand and use.

An ACCESS integration roadmap details the ACCESS coordination services most appropriate
for a specific kind of cyberinfastructure resource and the steps a resource provider
must take to participate in them.

Why Create a New ACCESS Integration Roadmap?
********************************************

If you're adding the first resource of a type that has never been integrated with ACCESS before,
there won't be an existing integration roadmap for you to follow. Creating a new roadmap
will help you be sure to take advantage of the coordination services ACCESS has to offer and will
give other resource providers a roadmap for adding their resources to ACCESS.

If it isn't likely there will ever be other resources like yours in ACCESS, you can
use the information below to plan your integration without actually creating an integration
roadmap.

ACCESS's Coordination Services
******************************

The major coordination services ACCESS currently offers are listed below. Each service
provides benefits to both researchers and resource providers. You should review this
list and decide which of these services would help you achieve your goals for ACCESS
integration.

- **ACCESS Resource Discovery:** An ACCESS-wide searchable/browseable directory of resources.
  Having a resource listed in ACCESS's resource directory provides greater visibility
  for the resource, helping resource providers recruit new users. Researchers have a
  convenient place to look for resources they can use to carry out their research projects.
- **ACCESS Allocations:** A system for requesting permission to use resources in support of
  research projects. Resource providers can use this to recruit new and returning users for their
  resources. Researchers use this to gain access to additional resources for their research
  projects.
- **ACCESS Coordinated User Support:** ACCESS-wide services for providing technical support to researchers.
  Researchers benefit from a single place to request help when using any ACCESS resource. Resource
  providers benefit from being able to collaborate with other ACCESS personnel on user support when
  issues involve ACCESS services or another ACCESS resource.
- **ACCESS Metrics and Monitoring:** An ACCESS-wide service for gathering and presenting
  resource usage metrics. Researchers have a single place to go to find out how much
  they've used of ACCESS resources and compare it to overall use. Resource providers
  get a standardized way to report use of their resources to sponsors and other stakeholders.
- **ACCESS Single Sign-On:** ACCESS-wide user identities and authentication service. Reseachers have a
  single ID to use with all ACCESS resources and single sign-on across ACCESS websites and resources.
  Resource providers can use ACCESS IDs and authentication rather than maintaining local accounts
  and user credentials (passwords, keys).

Form a Working Group to Develop an Integration Roadmap
******************************************************

When creating a new ACCESS integration roadmap, it's important to get input from
ACCESS service providers and---ideally---from other resource providers who are likely
to follow the roadmap. A good way to get that input is to form a working group.
ACCESS working groups allow stakeholders from the ACCESS projects and resources provider
organizations to meet regularly to work together on a common goal. For example,
you can launch a working group to create a new integration roadmap, invite
stakeholders from the relevant areas in ACCESS, and when the roadmap is completed,
the working group ends.

Creating a working group is easy. The first step is to draft a *charter*. The
charter defines the working group and has the following elements.

- A name for the working group
- An initial chairperson (two chairpersons is also fine)
- A one-paragraph statement of the working group's purpose
- A list of specific goals
- A list of stakeholders
- A tentative timeline for deliverables

*Stakeholders* are people who have or may have an interest in the outcome of the working
group or who have expertise that the working group needs. For example, you will likely
need representatives from the major ACCESS project areas and new or prospective ACCESS
resource providers. *Deliverables* are concrete things the working group will produce,
such as a new integration roadmap.

When you have your charter document, get it reviewed by your project leadership to
make certain you can work on it. Then, ask the ACCESS Executive Committee (EC) to
review and approve the charter. <details>

Once your charter is approved, create a new folder for the working group within the
`ACCESS Working Groups
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1udqxZ_IjWP8n3lSWZZze8IrFmeB-g2CV>`_
Google Drive folder. Add the charter document.  Review the
`ACCESS cross-track technical coordination schedule
<https://access-ci.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACP/pages/9502721/Cross-Track+Technical+Coordination+Schedule>`_
to find a good time for the first meeting and ask on the ACCESS-CI slack's #access-wide
channel if anyone is using the two most-likely options, just in case.
Create a new document in the working group Google Drive folder for meeting agendas
and notes and include the date, time, and coordinates for the first meeting. (It's
helpful to keep all meeting notes in a single document so they can be referenced
during meetings.)

Finally, draft an announcement for the
working group that references the charter, key stakeholders who you'd like to have
participate, agenda for the first meeting, and meeting coordinates. Post the announcement
on the ACCESS-CI slack's #access-wide channel and the ACCESS-RP Communications slack's
#general channel. If you need participation by current resource providers, ask the
ACCESS Operations team to email your announcement to all current resource provider
contacts. Now you're ready for your first working group meeting!

What to Put In an Integration Roadmap
******************************************************

The audience of an ACCESS integration roadmap is a resource provider who needs to
integrate a new resource into the ACCESS ecosystem. Roadmaps consist of a series of
tasks that the resource provider must accomplish in order to set things up with the
appropriate ACCESS coordination services. For the technical details on how to construct the files needed for an integration
roadmap and its tasks in GitHub, please see the
`Contributing guide <https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/blob/main/docs/contributing.md>`_.

Most integration roadmaps have two types of tasks:

1. Establishing personnel contacts
2. Configuring and documenting software/services

In both cases, you'll need the ACCESS project representatives in your working group
to tell you what they need resource providers to do. This should be the main
topic in your working group meetings. Once you've described your resource and what
makes it different from the current resource types, the ACCESS area representatives
should be able to pinpoint tasks from other integration roadmaps that will be the same
in this new roadmap (and can be copied), tasks from other roadmaps that don't seem
applicable (and can be left out), and any new tasks that are needed for this
type of resource that haven't been necessary in other roadmaps.

In regard to **personnel contacts**, ACCESS areas typically need the resource provider to provide a list of contacts
for specific functions. It'll usually be a combination of management personnel (PIs,
project managers) and technical personnel (HPC system adminstrators, network administrators,
storage/data specialists, security personnel). Once all of the ACCESS representatives in your
working group have given you the contacts they need, consolidate them into a single
list and create a task at the beginning of the roadmap so the resource provider can
just fill out a single form with all of the necessary contact information.

For **configuring and documenting software and services**, each ACCESS project area will
have its own list of ways resource providers can engage with their area. It's very
likely these will be similar to (or even the same as) tasks in existing integration
roadmaps, so the working group representatives may only have to point to existing tasks
in other roadmaps and ask to have them included in your new roadmap. If the tasks don't need to be
customized, you can include them in your roadmap by reference instead of making new copies.
(Just be aware that if the task is edited for another roadmap, those edits will also appear
in your roadmap.) If a task needs to be customized for this type of resource, or if you
don't want to take the chance that edits to the task in other roadmaps also change the task in
your roadmap, make a copy. But if you make a copy, be aware that any improvements to the
task's text in other roadmaps won't be reflected in yours.

Get an Integration Roadmap Reviewed and Approved
******************************************************

Assuming you have the right stakeholders represented in your working group, you shouldn't
need additional reviews or approvals once the tasks have been finalized because everyone
who is involved in the roadmap will have been engaged already. Feedback from new resource
providers won't likely appear until your roadmap has been published and announced.
You can proceed directly to publishing and announcing your roadmap!

Publish and Maintain an Integration Roadmap
******************************************************

As outlined in the
`Contributing guide <https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/blob/main/docs/contributing.md>`_,
your new roadmap will consist of a pull request against the ACCESS Integration Roadmaps
GitHub repository. When you submit the pull request, it will be reviewed by the ACCESS
Operations team's Resource Integration specialists. The goal of this review
will be to ensure that the ACCESS Operation team can support resource providers in
carrying out the tasks in your roadmap. If they have any questions or concerns, they
will respond to the pull request with a list of suggestions or requests. Once the
pull request is approved and merged, your roadmap will be available to the ACCESS
community!

As new resource providers use your integration roadmap, the ACCESS Operations team
will collect feedback in support tickets and other channels. If changes are needed,
they can be made through 

Announce a New Integration Roadmap
******************************************************

Your new ACCESS integration roadmap will only be useful if people know about it! We
recommend the following ways to let relevant people know about your roadmap.

1. Post a link to it, including a brief blurb about what types of resources it's for,
   on the ACCESS-CI slack server's #access-wide channel.
2. Post the same announcement on the RP-ACCESS Communications slack server's #general
   channel.
3. Post a news item on the
   `ACCESS Infrastructure News <https://operations.access-ci.org/online_services/infrastructure_news>`_ publishing service. This will
   result in a news story in ACCESS's staff newsletter and one or more news channels
   for resource providers and other community members.
