ACCESS Integration Roadmaps: Compute
====================================

Infrastructure Type(s)
**********************

This roadmap integrates a high-performance computing
`HPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing>`_ cluster.
Researchers typically use HPC clusters by logging in to front-end nodes
where they install application software and run jobs under a batch
scheduler. Science gateways, workflow engines and other software tools
may perform these actions on the researchers behalf. Jobs may run
entirely in the background reading input data and generating output
data, may use interactive or steared input, and may generate live or
streamed visual output.
