# Science Gateway Description v1

Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Task

**Task Type(s)**: Coordination, Support  
**Start by phase**: Integration  
**Complete by phase**: Integration  
**Operator role(s)**: Gateway administrator

## Summary

The science gateway provider registers their gateway with ACCESS to provide publicly accessible and internally 
accessible information about the science gateway. This step also allows the request for the creation of community 
accounts on allocated resources.

## Prerequisite tasks

1.  The science gateway provider must have completed [Science Gateway Resource Requests](Science_Gateway_Resource_Requests_v1.md)

## Support Information

For assistance with this task see the *Support Information* section in the *Integration Roadmap Description*.

## Detailed Instructions

The science gateway provider must create an [Integration and Operations Request](https://operations.access-ci.org/help)
 - Set *ACCESS Operations Issue Type* to ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps 
 - Set *Infrastructure Information:* Science Gateway and specify the *Science gateway name*
 - Include all the details of the gateway in the summary. Please use the following template.

```
Institution Name: 

Science Gateway Name: 

Acronym: 

Public URL: 

Short Name: 

Short Description: 

Associated allocation ID(s): 

Status (in development or in production): 

Production date (when did/will it become): 

Gateway PI: Name <email> 

Gateway co-PIs: Name 1 <email>, Name 2 <email>

Gateway administrator(s): Name 1 <email>, Name 2 <email>

Cybersecurity and incident response contact(s): Name 1 <email>, Name 2 <email>

Integration coordinator: Name 1 <email>

```

*Integration coordinator* is the contact person from the science gateway side working with the ACCESS concierge on the 
integration process. 

Once the ticket is created, it will be reviewed by the ACCESS concierge and will get back to you for additional 
information. And then the ACCESS concierge would create/update the information in the ACCESS website. The task is completed 
when the gateway information is published to the ACCESS website and when community accounts are created on allocated 
resources.

ACCESS may periodically review registration information to confirm that it is correct. Gateway providers should create 
subsequent tickets in the future to update the information.
