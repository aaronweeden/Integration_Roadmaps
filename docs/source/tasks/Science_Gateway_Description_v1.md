Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Task

**Task Type(s)**: Coordination, Support  
**Start by phase**: Integration  
**Complete by phase**: Integration  
**Operator role(s)**: Gateway administrator

## Summary

The science gateway provider registers their gateway with ACCESS to provide publicly accessible and internally accessible information about the science gateway. This step also triggers the creation of community accounts on allocated resources.

## Prerequisite tasks

1.  The science gateway provider must have completed “Science Gateway Resource Requests”

## Support Information

For assistance with this task see the *Support Information* section in the *Integration Roadmap Description*.

## Detailed Instructions

The science gateway provider must provide information in gateway information register at XXX that should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

The task is completed when the gateway information is published to the ACCESS web site and when community accounts are created on allocated resources.

ACCESS may periodically review registration information to confirm that it is correct. Gateway providers should promptly update their registration information.

Science gateway providers register their gateway with ACCESS, providing the following information:

1.  The URL for the science gateway (displayed by ACCESS if the gateway is also in production).

2.  A short description of the gateway that can be displayed by ACCESS if the gateway is in production and which can help potential users find the gateway.

3.  A short name for the science gateway that complies with UNIX account name requirements, which may be used as community account names by Resource Providers.

4.  The gateway’s status, which can be “in production” and ready to accept users, or “in development.”

5.  Production date for the gateway. If your gateway is currently in production, estimate the date it was available to the community.
