This contact(s) will work with Allocations and/or other ACCESS tracks to provide documentation/user guides for each of their resources. The contact will be the main liaison for Allocations as well as user community and review panels. RP contact will need to provide available resource information, review proposals of smaller Allocation requests. Contact will need to provide resource information for resource(s) and keep CiDeR updated for the life of resource(s). Create a [*ticket*](https://access-ci.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2) with subject “Track 1 Roadmaps - allocations contact” or email [*hackwort@psc.edu*](mailto:hackwort@psc.edu) to provide contact details.  
  
Instructions for entering resource information into CiDeR are specified in a later roadmap step: [*Infrastructure Description*](Infrastructure_Description_v2.md)
