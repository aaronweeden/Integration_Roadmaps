# Summary

ACCESS uses affinity groups to enable communications among members of
communities. Science gateway providers should join the science gateway
affinity group and the affinity groups of any resource providers that
the science gateway uses.

# Prerequisites

1.  The gateway should have completed registration. See "Science Gateway
    > Registration".

# Effort

See
[[https://support.access-ci.org/affinity-groups]{.underline}](https://support.access-ci.org/affinity-groups)
for a listing of groups and steps for joining.

Science gateways may want to also create their own affinity group.

# Description

Resource providers use affinity groups to communicate with their users,
including science gateway providers. The science gateway provider may
wish to communicate this information to their users through their own
communication channels.

ACCESS science gateway community members and ACCESS staff communicate
using the science gateways affinity group. This may for example include
changes to policies, new services, and informal support.

Some resource providers may have additional communication channels.
