# Summary

Science gateway operators use their allocations to request computing and
storage from ACCESS resource providers that support science gateways.

# Prerequisites

1.  The science gateway operator must have an awarded allocation. See
    > "Science Gateway Allocation Application". Depending on the size of
    > the request, this could take days to weeks to complete.

# Effort

The gateway provider uses the ACCESS allocation request system to
transfer ACCESS credits to particular resource providers. See
[[https://allocations.access-ci.org/]{.underline}](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

The exchange request may take days or longer before approved by the
resource provider.

# Description

The science gateway provider uses standard ACCESS procedures to convert
ACCESS allocation tokens to computing time or storage on target
resources. The gateway provider should make sure that the resource
provider supports science gateway usage, which should be included in the
resource description.
