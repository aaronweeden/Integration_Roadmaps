# Summary

ACCESS resource and online service operators will be assigned tickets
for issues or questions about their resources and online services. They
will monitor the ticket system for tickets assigned to them, triage them
as necessary, reassign the request to other staff or organizations if
necessary, address requests they are able to address, and close the
request once it is resolved.

# Detailed Instructions

## Ticket Routing Queue Setup

If your organization/RP integrated other resources or services in the
past and already has ticket routing queues, you can use those for new
resources and you will not need to request new ones.

To request new organization/RP specific routing queues submitting an
ACCESS ticket using the [[Support Portal ticket
form]{.underline}](https://support.access-ci.org/open-a-ticket). Please
use the "Not related to a resource" selector (since your resource may
not be listed in the selector yet), select "No" for allocations related,
the "Operations Services" category and enter into the Synopsis "ACCESS
Ticket Routing Setup". In response to your request an ACCESS ticket
system administrator will configure the ticket system with queues for
your organization/RP and inform you when they are configured. Please
review the "For RP queues" and "For ACCESS awardee queues" sub-sections
below for additional details on what to include in your ticket.

#### For RP queues

If you are a resource provider (RP) integrating a resource, provide a
short organization name or abbreviation that can be used to define your
RP queue. Theis queues will be named "0-\<short_name\>".

Identify for this queue the name and ACCESS usernames of:

1.  People that can UPDATE tickets in the queue

2.  People that can ONLY VIEW tickets in the queue

3.  Person who will be assigned tickets by default (this person will be
    > able to reassign tickets to anyone else with queue access)

#### For ACCESS awardee queues

If you are an ACCESS awardee integrating a service, provide a short name
or abbreviation for new track specific queues you want setup. The queue
names should follow these guidelines:

-   [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIB9PhXnQ0BXFsgNNrx9JMUpkWje5zvrUQfcnmr-C6s]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIB9PhXnQ0BXFsgNNrx9JMUpkWje5zvrUQfcnmr-C6s)

Identify for each new queue the name and ACCESS usernames of:

1.  People that can UPDATE tickets in the queue

2.  People that can ONLY VIEW tickets in the queue

3.  Person who will be assigned tickets by default (this person will be
    > able to reassign tickets to anyone else with queue access)

Also provide any keywords related to your services that would help
individuals recognize that a ticket should be routed to this queue. For
example, an ACCESS-ACO-Support queue might have keywords "confluence" or
"access wiki" associated with it to indicate that access wiki or
confluence issues should be assigned to this queue.

## Ticket Handling

Resource and online service operating organization staff will receive
email from the ticket system, or access the ticket system online at:

-   [[https://tickets.access-ci.org]{.underline}](https://tickets.access-ci.org)

Tickets will usually be assigned to a default assignee in each queue.

Ticket handling typically involves these activities.

## Reassign Externally, Accept, or Reassign Internally

The default assignee or anyone with update access to tickets in the
queue should first determine if the ticket was properly assigned and if
not, reassign to a different queue.

If the ticket was assigned to the correct queue, they may reassign it to
anyone else in their organization with ticket system access, or retain
ownership of the ticket.
