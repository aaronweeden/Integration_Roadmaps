# Summary

A science gateway provider needs to have an active allocation for their
science gateway.

# Prerequisites

None

# Effort

Effort level varies by the request track. See
[*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/)
for more information. Science gateway providers can request allocations
of any size.

Depending on the size of the allocation request, this step could take
days to weeks before the award is made.

# Description

ACCESS allocations are exchanged for computing time and other resources
or services provided by ACCESS resource providers. Allocations can be
used for provisioning computing resources for software executions on
high performance computers, for data storage, and for virtual machines
to host services.

The science gateway provider requests an ACCESS allocation through the
standard process described at
[*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

Under certain circumstances, a science gateway provider can request
multiple allocations:

- A gateway provider can have a separate research allocation.

- A gateway provider who operates multiple science gateway can have one
  > allocation per gateway.
