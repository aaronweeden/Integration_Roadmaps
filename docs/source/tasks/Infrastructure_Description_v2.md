**RP role(s)**: Resource Integration Coordinator, Documentation and

# Summary {#summary .unnumbered}

ACCESS infrastructure that is visible to researchers, resource
providers, developers, other ACCESS awardees, or the broader community
must be described. ACCESS resource providers, ACCESS projects, and other
ACCESS affiliated online service providers (i.e. science gateways, etc.)
enter basic information about their organization and then describe the
infrastructure that they operate in the Cyberinfrastructure Description
Repository (CiDeR). Audience relevant summaries of these descriptions
are displayed in ACCESS websites.

Initial setup involves resource integration coordinators gaining
administrator access to CiDeR so they can authorize others in their
organization to enter and maintain infrastructure descriptions. This
task should take \~Â½ hour. Organization staff enter initial descriptions
and maintain accurate infrastructure descriptions in CiDeR. This task
should take \~1 hour/year per resource.

This integration task replaces and improves the [[Infrastructure
Description v1
task]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJCEFLL1vjSOo-plBRK67qwTePXahbvsuZVoGOlYTFg).
Operators that completed the v1 task already completed this task.

## Provide CiDeR access to other organization staff

The resource integration coordinator grants other organization staff
access to enter and maintain infrastructure descriptions:

-   Select "Service Providers" or "Organizations" along the top.

-   Click on your "Organization" name.

-   Click on "Administrators".

-   Add additional Organization Admins who may enter and update your
    > organization resource information.

## Enter Resource Conversion Factors

Skip this section if you resource is not ACCESS allocated

Page 16 of the CiDeR/RDR Manual has instructions for entering a
"conversion factor". This is the NU conversion factor of your resource,
divided by 21.576. This will be used to compute your initial marketplace
exchange rate. [**For most compute resources, you should NOT change the
conversion factor that you already have listed.\
\
**In a later stage of ACCESS, additional tools will be created to manage
your variable marketplace exchange rate.]{.mark}
