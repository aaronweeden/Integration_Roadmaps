# Summary

Science gateways use community accounts to provide single accounts for
all gateway users.

# Prerequisites

1.  The gateway provider must have completed registration. See "Science
    > Gateway Registration."

# Effort

The science gateway provider should confirm that the community accounts
are created and accessible. It may take hours to days for accounts to be
created after registration.

The science gateway provider may need to take additional, resource
provider-specific steps to enable the account. This may include, for
example, providing specific IP addresses or registering SSH keys that
the science gateway will use when accessing the resource provider.

# Description

Community accounts are UNIX accounts on ACCESS resource providers that
can be used by a science gateway's users through the science gateway's
user or programming interface. Science gateway providers request
community accounts as part of the registration process. Accounts are
created by ACCESS internal mechanisms.
