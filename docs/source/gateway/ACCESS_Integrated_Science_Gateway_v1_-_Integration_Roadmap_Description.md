# ACCESS Integrated Science Gateway v1

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates a science gateway service ([*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway)). Science gateways provide web-based interfaces that link advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) components to enhance usability. The CI components linked by a science gateway differ based on specific user community needs, but can consist of one or more of the following components: High performance computing (HPC), data management, cloud-based resources, high throughput computing (HTC), user management, and authentication, authorization, and other security services.

## Summary

The ACCESS program ([*https://access-ci.org*](https://access-ci.org)) enables researchers and educators to gain access to advanced computing, visualization, and data resources to accomplish their research or classroom objectives using an allocations process described at [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

This roadmap details the tasks that a gateway providing organization must perform to make their gateway operational within the ACCESS environment. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and production operations of the gateway, including coordination, technical integration tasks, and ongoing support activities.

## Operator Information

Operators planning to integrate a science gateway into ACCESS with this roadmap should contact ACCESS Operations to start the integration process (see details in the first task below). ACCESS Operations will assign a Concierge Integration Expert to provide personalized hands-on assistance with the integration process, schedule an online meeting between the gateway provider staff and ACCESS staff to launch the integration process, and provide instructions on how to track the integration progress.

Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

## Support Information

Science gateway providers needing assistance with roadmap tasks may submit an ACCESS Integration and Operation Support using instructions on [*this page*](https://operations.access-ci.org/help). Pick the ACCESS Operations Issue Type that best matches your request, or the catch all “ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps” issue type. If you need to talk to someone please contact your assigned Concierge Integration Expert, or the ACCESS Operations Resource Provider Coordinator.
