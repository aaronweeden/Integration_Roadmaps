# ACCESS Integrated Science Gateway v1

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates a science gateway service ([*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway)). Science gateways provide web-based interfaces that link advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) components to enhance usability. The CI components linked by a science gateway differ based on specific user community needs, but can consist of one or more of the following components: High performance computing (HPC), data management, cloud-based resources, high throughput computing (HTC), user management, and authentication, authorization, and other security services.

## Summary

The ACCESS program ([*https://access-ci.org*](https://access-ci.org)) enables researchers and educators to gain access to advanced computing, visualization, and data resources to accomplish their research or classroom objectives using an allocations process described at [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

This roadmap details the tasks that a gateway providing organization must perform to make their gateway operational within the ACCESS environment. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and production operations of the gateway, including coordination, technical integration tasks, and ongoing support activities.

## Operator Information

Operators planning to integrate a science gateway into ACCESS with this roadmap should contact ACCESS Operations to start the integration process (see details in the first task below). ACCESS Operations will assign a Concierge Integration Expert to provide personalized hands-on assistance with the integration process, schedule an online meeting between the gateway provider staff and ACCESS staff to launch the integration process, and provide instructions on how to track the integration progress.

Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

## Support Information

**Submit a Request**: Science gateway providers needing assistance with integration tasks can submit an *ACCESS Integration and Operation Support Request* using instructions on [*this page*](https://operations.access-ci.org/help). Pick an “*ACCESS Operations Issue Type*” that best matches your request, or the catch-all issue type “*ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps*“.

**Slack Discussion**: ACCESS has a Slack channel for infrastructure operators and ACCESS to discuss integration topics. For access submit a request to be invited to the ***RP-ACCESS \#integration-roadmaps*** Slack channel.

**By Weekly Meetings**: ACCESS holds a Zoom meeting every second Friday from 11:00 AM to Noon Central for infrastructure operators and ACCESS to discuss integration topics. To obtain Zoom coordinates submit a request for the **RP and ACCESS Roadmaps** Zoom meeting coordinates.

**Integration Consultants**: ACCESS integrated science gateway providers have a *Concierge Integration Expert* consultant available for one-on-one integration support.
